## Job Hunting Guide. Just Grok It ⚡

__*List 50 job openings for a mid-level Software Engineer / Software QA role requiring 3+ years of experience or entry-level Security Engineer Role that sponsors H1B visa from top 100 US companies. Provide a link to the relevant job application or the careers page*__

Below is a curated list of 50 job openings for __*mid-level Software Engineer / Software QA roles*__ (requiring 3+ years of experience) or __*entry-level Security Engineer roles*__ that potentially offer __*H1B visa sponsorship*__ from top 100 U.S. companies (based on rankings like Fortune 100 or similar). Due to the dynamic nature of job postings, not all listings explicitly confirm H1B sponsorship in the job description, but I’ve prioritized companies known for sponsoring H1B visas based on historical data (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Amazon) or roles where sponsorship is explicitly mentioned or likely. Each entry includes the job title, company, location, a brief description, and a link to the job application or careers page. If a specific job link is unavailable, the company’s careers page is provided.


## Notes
- **H1B Sponsorship**: Many top U.S. companies sponsor H1B visas, especially for tech roles, but explicit mention in job postings is rare. I’ve included companies with a strong history of H1B sponsorship (e.g., based on MyVisaJobs data or industry trends).
- **Availability**: Job postings may expire or change. If a link is broken, check the company’s careers page for similar roles.
- **Top 100 Companies**: Refers to Fortune 100 or similar rankings (e.g., tech giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others like JPMorgan, Walmart).
- **Limitations**: Due to the constraint of verifying 50 active postings in real-time, some links point to careers pages where you can search for similar roles if the exact job isn’t listed.
- **Date**: Listings are based on information available as of April 20, 2025.

## Additional Notes

- **How to Verify H1B Sponsorship**: If sponsorship isn’t explicitly mentioned, contact the company’s HR or check the [USCIS Employer Data Hub](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub) for their H1B petition history.
- **Job Search Tip**: Use filters on company career pages (e.g., “Software Engineer,” “Security Engineer,” “Visa Sponsorship”) or job boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, or [h1bvisajobs.com](https://h1bvisajobs.com/) to find similar roles.
- **Dynamic Listings**: Some roles may no longer be active. Search the company’s careers page for “Software Engineer,” “QA Engineer,” or “Security Engineer” to find updated postings.
- **Alternative Sources**: Check GitHub repositories like [jobright-ai/Daily-H1B-Jobs-In-Tech](https://github.com/jobright-ai/Daily-H1B-Jobs-In-Tech) or [Lamiiine/Awesome-daily-list-of-visa-sponsored-jobs](https://github.com/Lamiiine/Awesome-daily-list-of-visa-sponsored-jobs) for daily H1B job updates.

P.S. This prompt was inspired by the frustration many have voiced in recent months regarding LinkedIn’s new verification system, which often leads to individuals being __*de-platformed due to automated verification checks*__. Additionally, there are significant privacy concerns surrounding the data required for the verification process, which already entails longer-than-usual wait times. Furthermore, users have expressed dissatisfaction with the __*professional pressure*__ that LinkedIn can impose. The platform tends to promote a curated image, compelling individuals to showcase an __*idealized version*__ of themselves. This can lead to unhealthy comparisons with peers as users observe the successes and achievements of others. The pressure to __*actively network and produce engaging content*__ can be overwhelming, particularly for those who are introverted or uncomfortable with self-promotion. Consequently, many are exploring alternative options. __*Grok*__, which scrapes employers’ career sites to provide __*up-to-date job listings*__, has emerged as a more reliable and trustworthy resource. This approach also encourages individuals to apply directly through company websites, allowing them to gain a better understanding of the __*company’s culture and vision*__. Also, Grok by xAI is now available as a standalone app on iOS and Android, and it is also accessible on the web. This means users can access Grok’s AI-powered assistant features without needing an X (formerly Twitter) subscription. It’s a great way to enjoy the benefits of the platform’s AI assistant without having an active social media presence. Lately, there has been an emerging exodus from social media, with people moving away for good and exploring subscription-based models to build and engage followers who read their content. Examples include platforms like Substack for newsletters, Patreon for creator support, and Memberful for membership sites, as well as customized blogging sites and wiki pages tailored to individual needs.

Finally, at this point, seeing people mass-apply to __*1000's of jobs*__ and receive __*over hundreds of rejections*__ in their pursuit of a sustainable living makes tech no longer seem like a viable career path. The highly competitive nature of the field, systemic job displacement by AI, and broader economic factors have transformed what was once the most coveted profession into a disillusioning pursuit. Furthermore, __*AI—a dumb, unconscious entity that lacks any sense of conscience*__—merely functions as an __*abstraction layer*__, much like Gherkin does for non-technical stakeholders. Those who abstain from using AI and take pride in deep learning—more suited as a __*hobby or supplementary skill*__—may be missing the broader point. While having a __*solid foundation*__ in computer science is certainly advantageous, in today's age of __*AI-driven workflows*__, it’s wiser to ride the wave than to swim against the tide. Regardless, I hope this helps others keep going in their future endeavors.



> Happy Easter!! 🐰🥚🧺
